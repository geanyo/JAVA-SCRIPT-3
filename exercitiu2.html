        <p> Wait a minute, I said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There's nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what I had in mind. The type is all in Helvetica, which I like, bui ii doesn't excite me at all. There is just no character to anything here. lt has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilia. I really need something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it. </p>
